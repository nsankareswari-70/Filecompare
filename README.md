# File contents comparison in Python
Project Description:
In this project, I created two text files containing lists of items and developed a Python program to compare their contents. The script identifies similarities and differences between the two files, demonstrating how to efficiently handle file reading, comparison, and data processing in Python.
```
file1=open("page1.txt","w")
file1.write("hello \n")
file1.write("sun \n")
file1.write("moon \n")
file1.write("trees \n")
file1.write("cloud \n")
file1.close()

file2=open("page2.txt","w")
file2.write("flowers \n")
file2.write("Lotus \n")
file2.write("sunflower \n")
file2.write("trees \n")
file2.write("cloud \n")
file2.close()
```
